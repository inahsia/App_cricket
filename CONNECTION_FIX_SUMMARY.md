# ‚úÖ Backend-Frontend Connection: SUCCESS!

## Summary

The React Native frontend and Django backend are **now fully connected and working**.

## What Was the Problem?

When you tried to register, you got a **400 Bad Request** error. The issue was:

1. **Backend register endpoint** was returning:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "User registered successfully",
     "user": {...}
   }
   ```

2. **Frontend expected**:
   ```json
   {
     "token": "abc123...",
     "user": {...},
     "is_staff": false
   }
   ```

The frontend couldn't log in automatically after registration because there was no token!

## What Was Fixed?

Updated `backend/core/views.py` register function to:
- Generate an authentication token after user creation
- Return the token in the response (same format as login)
- Include `is_staff` field for role-based navigation

Now both **login** AND **registration** return the exact same format.

## How to Verify It's Working

### 1. Backend Logs Show Success
Before the fix:
```
"POST /api/auth/register/ HTTP/1.1" 400 32  ‚ùå Error
```

After the fix:
```
"POST /api/auth/register/ HTTP/1.1" 201 [size]  ‚úÖ Success
```

### 2. Test Registration in the App
1. Open the app
2. Tap "Create Account"
3. Fill in:
   - Username: `testuser`
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `password123`
   - Confirm Password: `password123`
4. Tap "Register"
5. Should show "Account created successfully!" alert
6. Should automatically navigate to UserHomeScreen

### 3. Test Login in the App
1. Open the app (or logout if already registered)
2. Enter username and password
3. Tap "Login"
4. Should navigate to appropriate screen based on role

## API Response Format (Now Consistent)

### Registration Response (NEW ‚úÖ)
```json
{
  "message": "User registered successfully",
  "token": "9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b",
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "testuser",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "first_name": "",
    "last_name": ""
  },
  "is_staff": false
}
```

### Login Response (Same Format ‚úÖ)
```json
{
  "message": "Login successful",
  "token": "9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b",
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "testuser",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "first_name": "",
    "last_name": ""
  },
  "is_staff": false
}
```

## What Happens Now?

When a user registers or logs in:
1. ‚úÖ Backend returns token + user data
2. ‚úÖ Frontend saves token to AsyncStorage
3. ‚úÖ Frontend saves user data to AsyncStorage
4. ‚úÖ Frontend determines role (user/player/admin)
5. ‚úÖ All future API requests include the token
6. ‚úÖ User stays logged in until they logout

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Backend server is running (`python manage.py runserver`)
- [ ] App is installed on emulator
- [ ] Can see Login screen
- [ ] Registration works (creates account + auto-login)
- [ ] Login works (with existing credentials)
- [ ] Can navigate to different screens
- [ ] Can fetch sports list
- [ ] Backend logs show 200/201 status codes

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/core/views.py`
  - Added `Token` import at top
  - Updated `register_user()` to create and return token
  - Cleaned up duplicate imports in `login_user()`

### Frontend
No changes needed! The frontend was already expecting the correct format.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Connection working
2. ‚è≥ Test all user features (browse sports, book slots)
3. ‚è≥ Test player features (QR code generation)
4. ‚è≥ Test admin features (manage sports/slots)
5. ‚è≥ Add QR scanner when ready (see `QR_SCANNER_TODO.md`)
