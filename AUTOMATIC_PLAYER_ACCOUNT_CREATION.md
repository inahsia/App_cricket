# Automatic Player Account Creation - Implementation Guide

## Overview
Your Red Ball Cricket Academy app already has **automatic player account creation** fully implemented. When users book a slot and add players, accounts are automatically created for each player with the default password "redball".

---

## Backend Implementation (Django)

### 1. Database Schema (`core/models.py`)

#### CustomUser Model
```python
class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
    """Custom User model using email as username"""
    username = None
    email = models.EmailField(_('email address'), unique=True)
    
    USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = []
```

#### Player Model
```python
class Player(models.Model):
    """Players associated with a booking"""
    booking = models.ForeignKey(Booking, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='players')
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField()
    phone = models.CharField(max_length=15, blank=True, null=True)
    user = models.OneToOneField(CustomUser, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True, related_name='player_profile')
    qr_code = models.ImageField(upload_to='qr_codes/', blank=True, null=True)
    qr_token = models.CharField(max_length=512, blank=True, null=True)
    check_in_count = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    last_check_in = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

### 2. Automatic Account Creation Signal

The `post_save` signal on the `Player` model automatically:
1. Creates a `CustomUser` account with email and password "redball"
2. Sets user type to 'player' in `UserProfile`
3. Generates QR code for check-in/out
4. Sends welcome email with credentials

```python
@receiver(post_save, sender=Player)
def ensure_player_account_qr_and_email(sender, instance: Player, created, **kwargs):
    """On Player create: Create user, generate QR, send email"""
    if not created:
        return

    player = instance

    # 1) Create/attach user account
    user = player.user
    if not user and player.email:
        user = CustomUser.objects.filter(email__iexact=player.email).first()
        if not user:
            user = CustomUser.objects.create_user(
                email=player.email,
                password='redball',  # Default password
                first_name=player.name,
            )
        # Mark as player
        profile, _ = UserProfile.objects.get_or_create(user=user)
        if profile.user_type != 'player':
            profile.user_type = 'player'
            profile.save()
        player.user = user
        player.save(update_fields=['user'])

    # 2) Generate QR code
    if not player.qr_code:
        player.generate_qr_code()
        player.save(update_fields=['qr_code'])

    # 3) Send welcome email
    send_player_credentials_email(player.email, player.name, ...)
```

### 3. API Endpoint (`core/views.py`)

#### Add Players Endpoint
```python
@action(detail=True, methods=['post'], permission_classes=[IsAuthenticated])
def add_players(self, request, pk=None):
    """Add multiple players to a booking"""
    booking = self.get_object()
    
    # Validate payment
    if not booking.payment_verified:
        return Response({'error': 'Payment must be verified'}, status=400)
    
    # Get players data
    players_data = request.data['players']
    
    # Check player limits
    max_allowed = booking.slot.max_players
    current_count = booking.players.count()
    available_slots = max_allowed - current_count
    
    # Create players (automatic account creation happens via signal)
    created_players = []
    with transaction.atomic():
        for player_data in players_data:
            player = Player.objects.create(
                booking=booking,
                name=player_data['name'],
                email=player_data['email'],
                phone=player_data.get('phone', '')
            )
            created_players.append(player)
    
    return Response({
        'message': f'{len(created_players)} player(s) added successfully',
        'players': PlayerSerializer(created_players, many=True).data
    })
```

## Frontend Implementation (React Native)

### 1. Add Players Screen (`frontend/src/screens/user/AddPlayersScreen.tsx`)

**Features:**
- Displays booking details
- Shows current players
- Shows available slots
- Button to add players
- Instructions about account creation

**Key Components:**
```tsx
const AddPlayersScreen = () => {
  const [booking, setBooking] = useState<BookingDetails | null>(null);
  const [showForm, setShowForm] = useState(false);

  // Load booking details
  const loadBookingDetails = async () => {
    const bookingData = await BookingsService.getBookingById(bookingId);
    const playersData = await BookingsService.getBookingPlayers(bookingId);
    setBooking({ ...bookingData, players: playersData });
  };

  // Handle successful player addition
  const handlePlayersAdded = (playersAdded: number) => {
    Alert.alert(
      'Success!',
      `${playersAdded} player(s) added. Welcome emails sent to all players.`
    );
    navigation.goBack();
  };

  return showForm ? (
    <AddPlayersForm
      bookingId={booking.id}
      maxPlayers={booking.slot.max_players}
      currentPlayerCount={booking.players.length}
      onSuccess={handlePlayersAdded}
      onCancel={() => setShowForm(false)}
    />
  ) : (
    <ScrollView>
      {/* Booking Details */}
      {/* Current Players List */}
      {/* Available Slots */}
      {/* Add Players Button */}
      {/* Instructions */}
    </ScrollView>
  );
};
```

### 2. Add Players Form Component (`frontend/src/components/AddPlayersForm.tsx`)

This component provides:
- Dynamic form to add multiple players
- Name and email input for each player
- Validation
- Submit to backend API

### 3. Bookings Service (`frontend/src/services/bookings.service.ts`)

```typescript
class BookingsServiceClass {
  async addPlayers(bookingId: number, players: Array<{name: string; email: string}>) {
    const response = await ApiService.post(
      `${API_ENDPOINTS.BOOKINGS}${bookingId}/add_players/`,
      { players }
    );
    return response.data;
  }

  async getBookingPlayers(bookingId: number) {
    const response = await ApiService.get(
      `${API_ENDPOINTS.BOOKINGS}${bookingId}/players/`
    );
    return response.data;
  }
}
```

## How It Works - Step by Step

### User Flow:

1. **User books a slot** and completes payment
2. **User navigates to "Add Players"** screen
3. **User fills out the form** with player names and emails
4. **Form submits to backend** API endpoint
5. **Backend creates Player records**
6. **Django signal fires automatically:**
   - Creates `CustomUser` account with email and password "redball"
   - Sets `UserProfile.user_type = 'player'`
   - Generates QR code for the player
   - Sends welcome email with credentials
7. **Player receives email** with:
   - Login credentials (email + password "redball")
   - Booking details (sport, date, time)
   - Instructions to download the app
8. **Player logs in** to the mobile app
9. **Player sees their QR code** in the app
10. **Player uses QR code** for check-in/out at the academy

---

## Email Template

Players receive an email like this:

```
Subject: Your Player Account - Red Ball Cricket Academy

Hello [Player Name],

An account has been created for you at Red Ball Cricket Academy.

Login Details:
Email: [player@example.com]
Temporary Password: redball

Booking Details:
Sport: Cricket
Date: December 25, 2025
Time: 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM

Use the app to view your QR code and check-in on the day of your booking.
For security, please change your password after first login.

Regards,
Red Ball Cricket Academy
```

## Testing Instructions

### Backend Testing (Django Admin):
1. Go to Django Admin: `http://localhost:8000/admin`
2. Navigate to `Core > Players`
3. Check that each player has:
   - Associated `user` field populated
   - QR code generated
   - Correct email

### Frontend Testing (React Native App):
1. **Book a slot** as a regular user
2. **Complete payment**
3. **Navigate to "My Bookings"**
4. **Tap on the booking** and select "Add Players"
5. **Fill in player details** (use real email to test email delivery)
6. **Submit the form**
7. **Check email inbox** for welcome email
8. **Log out and log in** as the player using email and password "redball"
9. **Verify QR code** is visible in the player dashboard

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Default Password**: "redball" is a weak password. Consider:
   - Forcing password change on first login
   - Generating random passwords and emailing them
   - Implementing password reset flow

2. **Email Verification**: Currently no email verification. Consider adding it.

3. **Duplicate Accounts**: The system prevents duplicate players in the same booking but allows the same email across different bookings.

---

## Customization Options

### Change Default Password:
```python
# In models.py, line ~740
user.set_password('your_new_default_password')
```

### Customize Welcome Email:
```python
# In models.py, line ~760
send_mail(
    subject='Your Custom Subject',
    message='Your custom message...',
    ...
)
```

### Add Phone Number to Players:
Already supported! Just pass `phone` in the request:
```json
{
  "players": [
    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "phone": "+91 9876543210"
    }
  ]
}
```
