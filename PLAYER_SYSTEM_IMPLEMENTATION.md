# Player Account & Booking System - Implementation Summary

## âœ… Part 1: Auto-Create Player Accounts After Booking

### Backend Implementation (COMPLETE)

#### 1. **Automatic Account Creation**
- **Location**: `backend/core/models.py` - `ensure_player_account_qr_and_email` signal

- **Default Password**: `redball` (hardcoded as requested)
- **Features**:
  - Creates `CustomUser` with email as username
  - Sets default password to `redball`

  - Sends welcome email with credentials and booking details

#### 2. **Database Schema**
```python
CustomUser (AbstractUser):
  - email (unique, used as username)
  - password (hashed)
  - first_name, last_name

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### Scenario: Organizer Books a Slot

1. **User (Organizer) Books Slot**
   - Logs in as customer/user
   - Selects sport and time slot
   - Makes payment
   - Booking status: "confirmed"

2. **Organizer Adds Players**
   - Navigates to "My Bookings"
   - Selects the booking
   - Clicks "Add Players"
   - Fills form with player details:
     - Name: "John Doe"
     - Email: "john@example.com"
     - Phone: "1234567890"
   - Submits form

3. **Backend Processes Request**
   - Validates booking is paid
   - Checks player limits
   - Creates `Player` object
   - **Signal fires automatically**:
     - Creates `CustomUser` with email
     - Sets password to `redball`
     - Creates `UserProfile` (type='player')
     - Generates QR code
     - Sends email to john@example.com

4. **Player Receives Email**
   ```
   Subject: Your Player Account - Red Ball Cricket Academy
   
   Hello John Doe,
   
   An account has been created for you.
   
   Login Details:
   Email: john@example.com
   Password: redball
   
   Booking Details:
   Sport: Cricket
   Date: 2025-10-27
   Time: 09:00 - 11:00
   
   Use the app to view your QR code.
   Change your password after first login.
   ```

5. **Player Logs In**
   - Opens mobile app
   - Enters email: john@example.com
   - Enters password: redball
   - App routes to Player Dashboard

6. **Player Views Booking**
   - Dashboard shows:
     - Welcome message with name
     - Current status (Registered)
     - Booking details (sport, date, time)
     - QR code
   - "My Bookings" tab shows:
     - All bookings in list format
     - Organizer information
     - Detailed timing

7. **On Booking Day**
   - Player arrives at academy
   - Shows QR code to admin
   - Admin scans QR
   - Status updates to "Checked In"
   - When leaving, admin scans again
   - Status updates to "Checked Out"

## ðŸ”‘ Key Technical Details

### Authentication Flow
1. Login â†’ Backend validates â†’ Returns JWT + user_type
2. Frontend stores JWT in AsyncStorage
3. All API calls include: `Authorization: Bearer {token}`
4. Backend validates token and returns user-specific data

### Player Filtering (Backend)
```python
def get_queryset(self):
    user = self.request.user
    if user.is_staff:
        return Player.objects.all()  # Admin sees all
    profile = user.profile
    if profile.user_type == 'player':
        return Player.objects.filter(user=user)  # Player sees only theirs
    return Player.objects.filter(booking__user=user)  # Organizer sees their bookings' players
```

### Automatic Account Creation (Signal)
```python
@receiver(post_save, sender=Player)
def ensure_player_account_qr_and_email(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if not created:
        return
    
    # 1. Create/find user
    user = CustomUser.objects.create_user(
        email=instance.email,
        password='redball',
        first_name=instance.name
    )
    
    # 2. Set profile type
    profile = UserProfile.objects.get_or_create(user=user)
    profile.user_type = 'player'
    profile.save()
    
    # 3. Generate QR code
    instance.generate_qr_code()
    
    # 4. Send email
    send_player_credentials_email(...)
```
